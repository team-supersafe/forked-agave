//! This module contains any integration code to put the unified scheduler subsystem into the
//! banking stage, starting from `BankingPacketBatch` ingestion from the sig verify stage and to
//! `Task` submission to the unified scheduler.
//!
//! These preprocessing for task creation can be multi-threaded trivially, including
//! unified-scheduler specific task of UsageQueue lookups with BankingStageHelper. At the same
//! time, the maximum cpu core utilization needs to be constrained among this processing and the
//! actual task handling of unified scheduler. Thus, it's desired to share a single thread pool for
//! the two kinds of work. Towards that end, the integration was implemented as a callback-style,
//! which is invoked (via `select!` on `banking_packet_receiver`) at each of unified scheduler
//! handler threads.
//!
//! Aside from some limited abstraction leakage to make `select!` work at the
//! solana-unified-scheduler-pool crate, almost all of these preprocessing are intentionally
//! encapsulated into this module, at the cost of dynamic dispatch per each BankingPacketBatch to
//! retain the unified scheduler agnostic scheduler over scheduling mode (block verification vs
//! block production) as much as possible.
//!
//! Lastly, what the callback closure in this module does is roughly as follows:
//! 1. Translate the raw packet bytes into some structs
//! 2. Do various sanitization on them
//! 3. Calculate priorities
//! 4. Convert them to tasks with the help of provided BankingStageHelper (remember that pubkey
//!    lookup for UsageQueue is also performed at this step by UsageQueueLoaderInner
//!    internally; thus multi-threaded and off-loaded from the single-threaded-by-design
//!    scheduler thread)
//! 5. Submit the tasks.
